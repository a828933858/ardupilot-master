#APM Plus Hack#

We have made a hack of APM(ArduPilot Mega). We integrate an OSD module with the APM board called APM+ which removes the necessity of external OSD module like minimosd. We have also made an extend OSD board which can be hot plug to the APM2.X board. It can use either the original firmware or the OSD firmware (some rarely used features have been removed).

#Code hack#
The hacked code is located at branch PlaneOSD-*, CopterOSD-*
The latest build based on branch: PlanOSD-release and CopterOSD-3.2.1
The build firmware for extend OSD board can be download here:
